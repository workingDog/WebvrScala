# Scala.js interface to the WebVR API

The [WebVR](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/) API provides purpose-built interfaces to VR hardware 
to allow developers to build compelling, comfortable VR experiences.

Note: this is just a repository of some code. The Scala.js WebVR API should really be 
part of the [scala-js-dom](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-dom).
A pull request has been issued.
