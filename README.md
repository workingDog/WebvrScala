# Scala.js interface to the WebVR API

[WebVR](https://webvr.info/) is an experimental JavaScript API that provides access to Virtual Reality devices, 
such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, or Google Cardboard, 
in your browser.

The [WebVR API](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/) provides purpose-built interfaces to VR hardware 
to allow developers to build compelling, comfortable VR experiences.

This interface follows the specification of the [WebVR API, Editorâ€™s Draft, 3 November 2016](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/).

See also [MDN WebVR API Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) for additional information.
